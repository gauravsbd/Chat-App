# Chat with PDF using Gemini ðŸ’¬ðŸ“„

This project is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to upload PDF documents and ask questions about their content. The application uses **Google's Gemini/LLMs** for natural language understanding and FAISS for document vectorization, making it easy to extract and query information from uploaded PDFs.

## Features
- **PDF Upload:** Users can upload multiple PDF files for processing.
- **Text Extraction:** Extracts text content from PDF files.
- **Text Chunking:** Splits large texts into manageable chunks for better query handling.
- **Embedding Creation:** Generates embeddings for text chunks using Google Generative AI Embeddings.
- **Conversational QA:** Answers user queries using the context from the uploaded PDFs with accurate results.
- **Streamlit Interface:** User-friendly UI to interact with the application.
